Apache::AuthTkt
==================

Apache::AuthTkt is used to generate authentication tickets for use
with the 'mod_auth_tkt' apache authentication module. mod_auth_tkt is a
lightweight cookie-based authentication module written in C that is 
user repository agnostic (i.e. not tied to ldap/pam/radius etc.), and
supports single-signon across multiple apaches and machines. See
http://www.openfusion.com.au/labs/mod_auth_tkt/ for details, and the
Apache::AuthTkt perldocs.
